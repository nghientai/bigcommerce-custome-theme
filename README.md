### Overview
The test is not too hard, but it took time for me to do research. I am new with Stencil and Handlebar so it took time to look at the documentation, but it's worth. 

I like how the Bigcommerce organize the folder structures and codes. It's easy to find and custom. Although Bigcomerce's API is lack of some functions, but I still finished my work. 

Let's go over the tasks list: 

1. Create a feature that will show the second image when it's hovered on:
- It's easy and moved very quick.

2. "Add All To Cart" and "Remove All Items" button:
- Adding the button to the template.
- Create a JS file inside theme/ and injected it to the template.
- Utilize Store API to implement these functionalities. 

3. Display a banner that has customer information
- Utilize Customer Stencil Object to display the information.
